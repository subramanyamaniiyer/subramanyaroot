							Goodness Glows Liquid Foundation
							
							Amazing!
							I have used so many high end products &amp; nothing compares to this. My face is not oily by the end of the day. It glides on so well &amp; it actually feels moisturizing.

							Nourishing Mascara
							
							Absolutely Adore!
							I am so in love with this mascara! The color is great, the formula is better &amp; the brush is perfection! The formula is not thick &amp; goopy nor is it super thin &amp; wet. It's perfectly balanced. I'm so happy that the brush is the rubbery kind &amp; not one with the bristles. It makes application super easy. This mascara lasts all day &amp; does not flake off. It is easy to remove so you don't have to rub or irritate the sensitive skin of your eyes.

							Glossy Lipstick
							
							True Moisture!
							The Glossy Lipstick is a finally a product that offers true moisture to my lips! It applies on the lips smooth &amp; provides a nice tint of color. Note to self, the color is not super saturated. It looks more like a colored gloss but does provide a nice tint of color! Truly a great product!

							Blush
							
							Love the Color!
							Review: This blush is fabulous! The color is nice &amp; bright &amp; applies on the skin evenly! A little goes a long way. I suggest starting light on the application &amp; building because the color is nice &amp; saturated! Love this blush!

							Mattifying Powder Foundation
							
							Great product!
							Absolutely love this product. I was a bit skeptical about the coverage of powder foundation but this product provided great coverage &amp; did a great job addressing my oily skin. I was really impressed with how great my skin looked all day. It wasn't oily &amp; it evened out my skin, hiding many blemishes. Loved the design of the product as well, very cute &amp; unique.

							Eyeshadow Trio
							
							Beautiful Color Palette
							I love the colors of the eye shadow trio! It is very sheer when applied, &amp; provides just the right amount of color. I have sensitive eyes &amp; sometimes experience irritation when wearing eye makeup. I have had no issues at all with this makeup. I highly recommend!

							Nourishing Eyeliner Pencil
							
							Popping eyes!
							Perfect addition to any makeup lovers collection. The nourishing eye line glides in smoothly. I can easily line my eyes. The liner has a soft glide while applying. All day eyes is what you get! After work, dinner, running kids to activities &amp; talking my daily 3 mile run. I still have eyeliner that is not running or smudged under my eyes.

							Eyebrow Pencil
							
							Blends Great!
							I used the Brunette Brow Pencil. I was surprised at the softness of the pencil. It made applying the product very easy. The brush on the opposite end of the pencil made blending the color &amp; defining my brows so simple. Nice overall product.

							Glossy Lip Crayon
							
							Awesome buy - a must try
							The crayon glides on lips like butter &amp; gives beautiful color payoff. Very moisturizing just what lips needs on day to day basis. I would have liked more colors in this formula. Have two of the crayons &amp; want to try my hands on all the colors.

							Lip Shimmer
							
							Moisturizing 
							I have a few tubes of the Lip Shimmer. I like the fact that when I put it on; it stays on &amp; I also like the fact that it's natural; adds just a little bit of color &amp; it continues to moisturizes your lips.

							Satin Lipstick
							
							Great product!
							I use this all the time - my lips don't dry out &amp; the color lasts &amp; lasts! I would like to see more colors in the bronze range - I have one now but it's not quite dark enough. Keep up the great work!!
