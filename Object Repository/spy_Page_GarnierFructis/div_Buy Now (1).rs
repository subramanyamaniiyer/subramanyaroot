                  Some days, it can seem like there's no good defense against frizzy hair-and it's even worse when it's hot or humid outside. The best way to best hair frizz is to understand why it happens in the first place. Frizzy hair occurs when the cuticle, or the outer layer of your hair, is raised (think shingles), which causes your hair to look dry and puffy. When your cuticle lies flat, on the other hand, it appears smooth and shiny. Dryness is the root cause of frizzy hair, since the cuticles only lift in order to allow in moisture. (That's why it's so common in curly hair, which is notoriously dry.) 
                  How to Get Ridof Frizzy Hair
                  The number one way to prevent frizzy hair is to hydrate your hair. If your hair has enough moisture, the cuticles don't lift up and, instead, stay flat, giving each strand of hair a smooth look and texture. To help keep your hair hydrated on a regular basis, apply a frizz-fighting product or leave-in hair treatment, like Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Anti-Frizz Serum. This extra step minimizes dry hair and creates hair shine all day. If you have fine, frizzy hair, though, look for a lightweight hair care formula that won't drag hair down. 
                  If you get frequent blowouts, hair color treatments, or chemical processes, you may also have damaged hair (on top of just dry). That's where an intensive, moisturizing hair mask is especially valuable. Used once a week, it can provide deep hair hydration and hair repair. Look for hair masks infused with nourishing ingredients such as shea butter and oils such as coconut, avocado and argan oil.
                  
                    Also, avoid brushing your hair when it's dry. Doing so lifts the cuticle, which gives hair its frizzy hair appearance. Your best bet is to detangle hair with your fingers or a wide-toothed comb when it's still damp.
