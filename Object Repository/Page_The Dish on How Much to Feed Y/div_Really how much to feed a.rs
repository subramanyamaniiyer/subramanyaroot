              Really, how much to feed a cat depends on your cat. Things like the type of food you feed, your cat’s age and her lifestyle are all important factors. Keep reading to learn what you can do to determine how much food your cat should eat each day.  Step 1: Look at your cat's food If you’re asking yourself, “How much should I feed my cat?” look no further than the package. It has a wealth of information like ingredients, serving information and feeding instructions. This may not be the only place you need to look, but it’s a great start to determine how much you should be feeding your cat each day.   Step 2: Check out the pet food company's website If you have more questions than the package answers, go to your pet food's website. Many pet food brands have comprehensive websites that include a cat feeding chart or feeding guidelines, and even answers to frequently asked questions.  Step 3: Call the manufacturer If you have a very specific question about your cat’s diet and food, call the company. They will likely have a customer service specialist ready to answer questions just like, “How much should I feed my cat?”  Step 4: Treat wet and dry cat food differently When it comes to wet and dry cat food, your cat has different needs. That’s because wet and dry cat foods are formulated with different ingredients, calories and textures, etc. So, it makes sense that the answer to “How much dry food to feed a cat?” isn't the same as the answer to, “How much wet food to feed a cat?”    Step 5: Ask your veterinarian Your veterinarian is a pet expert, so she knows how much to feed a cat. More importantly, your veterinarian also knows your cat’s personality and health history. Her advice will be based on specific knowledge about your cat and her diet. Talking with your veterinarian might be the best way to reassure or direct you on how to feed your cat.  Your veterinarian considers your cat's: Life stage: A growing kitten has different nutritional needs than adult and senior cats.Breed: Genetics impact your cat’s body size and shape.Activity level: Every cat has a different personality and temperament. Some are sedentary while others are very active.  Step 6: Refer to a cat feeding guide Too much of a good thing, or overfeeding, can put your cat at risk for weight-related diseases. Likewise, underfeeding can negatively impact your cat's ability to stay healthy.
