      About

      What is Intel® Optane™ memory and why would I want a system that supports this?

      
      Intel® Optane™ memory is a system acceleration solution for new 7th Generation Intel® Core™ Processor-based platforms or later. This solution uses the Intel® Optane™ Technology, based on 3D XPoint™ memory media, along with the Intel® Rapid Storage Technology (Intel® RST) driver.

      When this new memory media is installed between the processor and slower SATA-based storage devices (HDD, SSHD or SATA SSD), the computer can store commonly used data and programs closer to the processor. This allows the system to access this information more quickly, which can improve overall system responsiveness.
      

       

      What is system acceleration? What is system responsiveness? Will Intel® Optane™ memory make my PC feel faster?

      
        System acceleration refers to the effect that Intel® Optane™ memory has on a computer. It enables faster task completion and reduces the wait time, compared to a computer with a hard disk drive alone.
      
      Responsiveness refers to how quickly the PC completes end user requests, such as:
        
          Start or boot
          Search and find files
          Save large files
          Launch applications
        
      Compared to the same PC with only a hard drive, yes, Intel® Optane™ memory makes the PC feel faster, more responsive and accelerated.
      
      

       

      How is Intel® Optane™ memory different from other NAND caching and caching solutions?
      
      Intel® Optane™ memory is a brand-new technology. It's built to address the need for non-volatile, high-performance, high-endurance, low latency, and Quality of Service (QoS). The combination of these attributes in a memory technology sets it apart from anything else.
      Intel® Optane™ memory is different from other NAND caching solutions for the following reasons:
      
        Revolutionary, new 3D XPoint™ Memory Media performs well even in low capacities (16 GB).
        Endurance to withstand multiple reads and writes to the module.
        Leading-edge algorithm in the Intel RST driver creates a high-performance solution.
        Its user-friendly, intuitive installation and easy set-up process help you automatically configure a solution to match your needs.
      
      
       

      What is the difference between Intel® Optane™ memory and DRAM? Does it replace DRAM?
      
      Intel® Optane™ memory uses non-volatile 3D XPoint™ memory with the Intel® Rapid Storage Technology driver to accelerate your PC's accesses to non-volatile data. In your PC, non-volatile data is your computer's &quot;long-term memory&quot; that persists even when the PC is powered off. A PC user's personal documents, pictures, videos, music and application files are examples of non-volatile data.
      DRAM, or Dynamic Random Access Memory, is a volatile memory technology that serves as your computer's &quot;short-term working memory&quot;. DRAM temporarily stores the inputs and results of calculations performed by the Processor. When the PC is powered off, the data in the DRAM disappears.
      The two memory technologies serve different purposes in the PC memory hierarchy, so Intel® Optane™ memory complements DRAM, rather than replacing it entirely. A computer with both Intel® Optane™ memory and DRAM can access programs and data faster, providing additional performance and responsiveness.
