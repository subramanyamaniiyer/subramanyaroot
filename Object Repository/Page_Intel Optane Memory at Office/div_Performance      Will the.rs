      Performance

      Will the performance of a mobile system be noticeably better if I buy a laptop that contains a hard drive and Intel® Optane™ memory? How will this compare to the same system that does not contain Intel® Optane™ memory?
      
      A laptop with a hard drive and Intel® Optane™ memory is about twice as responsive (as measured by SYSmark* 2014 SE (Responsiveness Subscore), on system configurations below).

      Baseline System (with HDD)
      Intel® Core™ i7-8650U Processor, 15W TDP, 4C8T, Turbo up to 4.2GHz, Memory: 2x4GB DDR4-2400, Storage: Seagate* ST1000LM048 2.5&quot; 5400 RPM 1TB HDD, OS: Windows* 10.

      System with 16GB Intel® Optane™ Memory
      Same configuration, with 16GB Intel® Optane™ Memory M10 Module.

      SYSmark* 2014 SE - benchmark from the BAPCo* consortium that measures the performance of Windows* platforms. SYSmark* tests four usage scenarios: Office Productivity, Media Creation, Data/Financial Analysis, and Responsiveness. SYSmark* contains real applications from Independent Software Vendors such as Microsoft* and Adobe*

      The benchmark results may need to be revised as additional testing is conducted. The results depend on the specific platform configurations and workloads utilized in the testing, and may not be applicable to any particular user's components, computer system, or workloads. The results are not necessarily representative of other benchmarks and other benchmark results may show greater or lesser impact from mitigations.

      Software and workloads used in performance tests may have been optimized for performance only on Intel microprocessors. Performance tests, such as SYSmark and MobileMark, are measured using specific computer systems, components, software, operations, and functions. Any change to any of those factors may cause the results to vary. You should consult other information and performance tests to assist you in fully evaluating your contemplated purchases, including the performance of that product when combined with other products. Visit the Performance Benchmark Test Disclosure for more information.
      
       

      Operating System

      What operating systems does Intel® Optane™ memory support when used for system acceleration?
      
      Intel® Optane™ memory requires Windows 10 64-bit to be used as a system accelerator.
