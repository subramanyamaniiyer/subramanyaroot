	Activate your phone online and enjoy the savings.


Select a phone
If you don't already have a phone you'd like to keep, Straight Talk has plenty to choose from. Select from a variety of the latest smartphones, including the Apple iPhone 8 and X as well as Android smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S9, all at Every Day Low Prices.
Straight Talk also offers a wide selection of phones under $100, like the Samsung Galaxy Luna Pro and the LG Rebel 3.

Coverage
A great deal on wireless is only as good as the coverage that goes along with it. If you keep your own phone, you can keep your current number and network. Straight Talk buys airtime from all four major networks rather than building a network of its own, so most phones will work just fine. In fact, by using the nation's leading cellular providers, over 99 percent of the country is covered.
To be sure that Straight Talk provides coverage in your local calling area, visit StraightTalk.com and enter the ZIP code where you'll use your Straight Talk phone the most.

No high-speed internet or landline is required plus you get all the features you need at no extra cost: voicemail, caller ID, three-way calling, call waiting, call forwarding, and even calls to 911. It's a cost-efficient alternative to existing landline services.
