					When to Switch From Kitten Food to Cat Food
					As a general rule, cats who are less than one year of age are considered kittens. It is important to feed your pet a kitten formula up to one year. The exception would be larger breed cats, such as the Maine Coon, which do not reach adult maturity until they are 18 months to two years of age.
					Can kittens eat adult cat food? The answer is on the label. If the bag reads &quot;for all life stages,&quot; then it is nutritionally sufficient for kittens. If it says &quot;for kittens,&quot; then it is specially formulated just for kittens.
					When can kittens eat dry food? Kittens can begin eating wet food at around four weeks old. As they grow used to eating solid food and their teeth continue to develop, you can begin mixing in dry food softened with a bit of water.
					How do you know when to switch to adult cat food? Generally, you should begin slowly transitioning your kitten to adult food when she is one-year-old, or when your veterinarian recommends doing so. Spread out the transition process over a 7- to 10-day period, gradually increasing the amount of her new food each day.
