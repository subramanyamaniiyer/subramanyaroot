              Switching dog foods Some dog owners wonder “is it bad to switch dog food?” Or question how to transition dog food the best way. Whether your puppy is growing or your dog has changing dietary needs, there are many reasons puppy and dog owners consider making a change. In fact, transitioning dog food can be safe, healthy and relatively simple. Owners should focus on patience and planning. These two elements make the process easier for you and for your pet.  Before you start Don’t be worried that you don’t know how to switch dog food. It becomes easy in a short period of time. Although you’ll be anxious to get the process started, switching dog food is a process. In order to see the difference your new food can make in your dog, please allow 7-10 days to ease the transition from his current food. Each day, simply feed a little less of the previous food and a little more of the new food until you’re feeding the new food exclusively. This gradual transition will help avoid unnecessary stomach upsets or dietary problems. Your how-to transition dog food plan: DAY 1-2 When transitioning dog food, introduce new food to your dog in small amounts, still primarily feeding him his old food. When switching dog food, measure the amount of new food that you're adding in and make sure to remove an equal amount of your dog's current food. (For example, if you are adding in a 1/8-cup of the new food, remove a 1/8-cup of the current food.) DAY 3-5 By now, transitioning dog food is part of your routine. Feed a little bit more of the new food to your dog each day, while continuing to remove the equivalent amount of the current food. DAY 6-7 Continue adding in your dog's new food, and removing an equal amount of the current food. By now the new food should be making up the majority of your dog's meal. DAY 7-10 Continue increasing the amount of the new food and decreasing your dog’s former food until you are feeding the new food exclusively. Now you’ve successfully completed switching dog food! These basic guidelines will set you and your dog up for a positive transition to a new food.
