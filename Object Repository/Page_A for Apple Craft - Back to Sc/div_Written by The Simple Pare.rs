            Written by The Simple Parent There's always some excitement when back to school season approaches. I think everyone likes buying new school supplies and thinking about new learning, new teachers, and new memories. Doing crafts is a great way to connect with the kids and keep them busy while reinforcing their learning.  But there's a lot that busy parents need to do too! Getting everything you need for school and at home as you get back into daily routines may give you a long to do list. While I'm out picking up all of our new school supplies, I'm also stocking up on basics for our home like toilet paper, paper towels, paper plates (for our busy nights), tissues and more! Some of these items are on the school supply lists so it's great to cross things off both lists at once!  Dollar General has been a go-to for many of the basics I need from Georgia-Pacific -- specifically toilet paper and paper towels. With a family, we go through a lot of paper towels and toilet paper. During the school year, I don't have as much time to run out and grab extra if we need it. So, I'm all about stocking up!  When we're getting crafty, I definitely depend on paper towels! No matter how careful we are, there always seems to be a bit of mess to clean up! Sparkle® paper towels are a staple in our house! So be sure to grab some and then make this easy A for Apple craft with your younger kids to celebrate Back to School!  A for Apple Craft Materials
	White, green, black and red construction paper
	Letter A letter cut out template
	White glue or glue stick
	Pencil
How to Make Apple Craft 
	Print the letter cut out template for the letter A.
	Cut it out and trace it onto the red paper. Cut it out.
	Glue the red letter A to the center of the white paper.
	Cut out small black seeds and glue to the center of the letter A (on the white paper).
	Cut out 2 leaves and one stem from the green paper and glue to the top of the letter A.
If you're using white glue, keep Sparkle® Paper Towels on hand to help you clean up any messes quickly! My kids always seem to get some extra glue somewhere, no matter how many times we say, &quot;Dot, dot, not a lot!&quot; when we do craft projects!  So, while your kids are having fun and practicing their basic skills after school or on the weekend, you can work on getting your home ready for the school year!  Back to school is a crazy time of year so anything that helps the transition go a bit more smoothly is something that we love to share with our fellow parents. There is more to back to school than new backpacks and shoes. Getting your home ready by stocking up on essential products from Georgia Pacific is a great way to make the fall get off to a great start. I'd love to showcase how to prep your home for back to school by showing how these products (and stocking up) can make the routines go smoothly!  We stopped by our local Dollar General and stocked up on the items we go through quickly. I picked up the Sparkle® 6 Family Roll packs and the Quilted Northern® 9 Mega roll packs.  We will not run out of paper towels or toilet paper the first week of school! Not this year! I'm also loving the fun Back to School print available on the Sparkle® paper towels at Dollar General! They're perfect for putting in lunches!   During the month of August, Dollar General has some great offers from Mon, 7/23 – Mon, 8/20 to help us save while we stock up:
	Buy Any 2 Quilted Northern® Packs, Save $2 – Must Buy 2 For Savings 
	Spend $15, Save $3 On Participating BTS Products (Including Sparkle® 3 Huge​ Roll – BTS Exclusive Pack) 
	Get Angel Soft® toilet paper 9 Mega Rolls - 2/$15
Plus, this year marks Georgia-Pacific's 25th anniversary and they're donating to the Dollar General Literacy Foundation! The Dollar General Literacy Foundation supports literacy and learning which is perfect for this time of year!  The Dollar General Literacy Foundation offers grant programs to qualifying organizations in the states where Dollar General stores are located! The foundation has awarded more than $146 million in grants to literacy organizations! As a former first grade teacher who spent years teaching kids to read, I love this! Dollar General and Georgia-Pacific are offering a great way for busy parents to stock up and be ready for the busy days and nights of those first few weeks of school!
