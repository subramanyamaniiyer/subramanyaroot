			De-stress with the derm!
			When it comes to taking care of yourself, Dr. Melissa K. Levin, dermatologist and founder of Entière Dermatology in NYC, knows that self-care is more than skin deep, so here are some simple tips she suggests to reduce day-to-day stress.
			

				
				
					Healthy living
					As a dermatologist, I’m a firm believer that healthy living equates to healthy skin. I’m much more thoughtful with what I’m putting in my body, but my ethos is all in moderation.
				
					Meditate
					Life can be chaotic, but through the practice of meditation, being present in the moment has made me more productive, calm, less stressed and ultimately, happy.
				
					Exercise
					Exercise decreases the level of a stress hormone in your body called cortisol. This can help you feel more relaxed and less stressed.
				
					Unplug
					On a daily basis, I make sure that I unplug from checking e-mails, texting and social media—even if it’s for a short 10-15 minutes.
				
					Sleep
					We know from multiple studies that sleep can decrease stress by improving and recovering the immune and neuroendocrine systems, which ultimately improves mood, productivity and memory.
